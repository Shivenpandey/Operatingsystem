Problem 1 :(Ques 18):- Ten students (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j) are going to attend an event. There are lots of gift shops, they all are going to the gift shops and randomly picking the gifts. After picking the gifts they are randomly arriving in the billing counter. The accountant gives the preference to that student who has maximum number of gifts. Create a C program to define order of billed students.

Solution Proposed for the above problem : The above problem is based upon the priority of students who have more gifts .If the student has more gifts than he will get the bill first .If two students have same number of gifts then the student who camed first will get billed first .here the students are considered as the processes .The process having maximum brust time will be implemented first.
